# SmartRocket
Code writen on Processing(a JAVA based environment)

Evolutionary rocket swamp uses genetic algorithm to reach the given target
The best from each generation is given more chance to reproduce or spread the genetic code that it has to the up coming generation.

The code needs high amount of fuel to get a better result(maybe this adds more variation to genes)
Fitness function works OK(might change it later).
Mutation should be kept low to avoid utter randomness.
Code has a function to move the given obstacle and also assign mouse as the obstacle.


All the variables are nicely labled ,you will understand what is for what.


P.S.:- Some generations may take few hundred generations. To avoid the same increase the amount of fuel, refresh or tweak the fitness function.
